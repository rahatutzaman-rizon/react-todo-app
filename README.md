Task: Todo List App
Description:
Your task is to create a simple Todo List application using React (reactjs/NextJS). The
application should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, tasks
should have a status (completed or incomplete). Each task will also have a priority
(low/ medium/ high). Each priority will have its own color which will indicate the
task’s priority in the tasklist. The application should display tasks in an organized
manner and provide basic functionality to manage them.
Requirements:
Task List Display:
● Display a list of tasks with their respective status (completed or not
completed).
● Each task should have options to mark as completed or delete.
● Include a counter for total tasks and completed tasks.
Task Management:
● Implement the ability to add a new task.
● Implement the ability to edit an existing task.
● Implement the ability to mark a task as completed.
● Implement the ability to delete a task.
Styling:
● Style the application for a clean and user-friendly interface using HTML
and CSS.
● You can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap if you prefer.
State Management:
● Utilize React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) as needed.
● Use any React state management tool to manage the application's
data (if needed).
